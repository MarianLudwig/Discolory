Setting:
	- Fantasy world
	- everything exists as long as the world has got energy


Characters:
	- 2 wizards: (maybe brothers) both students of the elder wizard, mastered the spell of casting the world's energy as color beams
	- elder wizard (not seen): last of the ancient wizards who can control the world's energy, died but so powerful as he was he can still contact his students
	- evil entity: eats energy of the world, which makes the world disappear


Story:
The last 2 wizards go through a dungeon to seek the one light stone, that destroys the evil and regains the earth's energy. 
Nearly finding it, the evil - who is about 4 minutes away - sees what the wizards are planning and sets off to hunt those wizards.
Being only minutes away from death, the wizards must walk through the rest of the dungeon and help each other to overcome the obstacles caused by the missing energy.


Intro:
The players find themselves in a dungeon room filled with colored stones.
They are seperated by a big fence. In front of each one a door.
With their magic they can shine these colored stones.
After aproximatly 15 seconds, the elder wizard speaks in their head (UI + voice over maybe): "The light stone is nigh! Make haste! The evil is coming!"
After 10 seconds, sound of earth shaking, the evil screams: "How dare you fighting me!? I'll turn you to darkness!"
Timer starts. Door opens (automatically or somehow)
